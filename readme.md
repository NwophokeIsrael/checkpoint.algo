# Sentence Analysis Algorithm

This JavaScript algorithm reads a sentence character by character, determines the length of the sentence, counts the number of words, and counts the number of vowels. It uses three variables as counters.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. The user is prompted to input a sentence ending with a period.
2. The algorithm analyzes the sentence character by character, incrementing counters for sentence length, word count, and vowel count as needed.
3. The algorithm adjusts the word count since the last word doesn't end with a space.
4. The algorithm prints out the length of the sentence, the number of words, and the number of vowels.
